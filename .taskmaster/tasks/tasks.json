Here's what was accomplished:\n\n**1. Server-Side Streaming (API Route):**\n- Implemented ReadableStream in `/api/chat/route.ts`\n- Uses OpenAI's streaming API with `stream: true`\n- Processes chunks in real-time and sends them as Server-Sent Events\n- Properly handles stream completion with `[DONE]` marker\n\n**2. Client-Side Streaming (useOpenAI Hook):**\n- Created streaming text processing in `useOpenAI.ts`\n- Implements `onStreamingChunk` callback for real-time updates\n- Handles stream completion with `onComplete` callback\n- Processes streaming data using TextDecoder for proper UTF-8 handling\n\n**3. UI Integration (Page Component):**\n- Real-time message updates as streaming content arrives\n- Smooth text appearance character by character\n- Maintains message state during streaming\n- Proper cleanup and error handling\n\n**Streaming Flow:**\n1. User sends message â†’ API route receives request\n2. OpenAI streams response â†’ API route processes chunks\n3. Chunks sent as SSE â†’ Client receives in real-time\n4. UI updates message content â†’ User sees text appearing progressively\n5. Stream completes â†’ Final message state saved\n\n**Technical Features:**\n- âœ… Real-time text streaming\n- âœ… Proper UTF-8 encoding/decoding\n- âœ… Stream completion handling\n- âœ… Error handling during streaming\n- âœ… Memory-efficient processing\n- âœ… Clean UI updates without flickering\n</info added on 2025-09-29T07:48:02.404Z>",

Test the application with proper environment setup\n2. Verify API key configuration\n3. Test error handling improvements\n</info added on 2025-09-29T07:52:59.600Z>",
